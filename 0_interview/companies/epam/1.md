1. Can you say me about your working experience, about technologies which you are working on? 
2. If you talk about react component:
- what is difference between functional and class component?
- How we handle with life cycle methods in functional components?
- How use effect hook works?
- If you do not have any props in dependency how does we hook work? - componentDidMount
- If you have some props in dependency how we will work in this case? - componentDidUpdate
- how can handle componentWillUnmount 
- What is high order component (HOC)? 
- Can you provide some builting high order component? 
- What is difference between controlled and uncontrolled component
- It's good use Id or not, and if we don't have id, how our program start work

Task #1 - implement searchResult react component, which makes request to server and shows results in dropdown. The main idea here - we have input, and user will put some data. Based on it, we will call API and show dropdown

```js
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
const API_URL = "https://test.com";

export function SearchResult() {
  const fetchData = searchParam => fetch(`${API_URL}?s=${searchParams}`)  
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {

    })
    .catch(error => console.log(error));
  
  return (
    <div>
       <input />
       <select>
       </select>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
const API_URL = "https://test.com";

export function SearchResult() {
  const [searchParam, setSearchParam] = useState(null);
  const [dropdownArr, setDropdownArr] = useState(null)
  
  const fetchData = searchParam => fetch(`${API_URL}?s=${searchParams}`)  
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setDropdownArr(data))
    .catch(error => console.log(error));

  const onChange = (event) => {
    setSearchQuery(event.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div>
       <input onChange={onChange} />
       <select>
         {dropdownArr.map((item, index) => {
            <option key={`${index}_result_data`}>
                {item}
            </option>
         })}
       </select>
    </div>
  )
}
```
